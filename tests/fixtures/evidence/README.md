# Evidence adapter fixtures

`cargo-audit-real.json` is **real output**, captured with
`cargo audit --json` in `agent-ix/quire-rs` on 2026-08-18. It is not
hand-written, and it is checked in unedited.

The ticket that asked for these adapters (agent-ix/quoin#115) was explicit:
decide the format questions *"by reading real output from each tool, not from
the spec of the format."* A fixture someone wrote to match their own reader
proves the reader parses itself.

What this file happens to contain is the case that matters most: **zero
vulnerabilities and one `unsound` warning**, alongside the `database`
(1217 advisories) and `lockfile` the scan consulted. That is a scan which ran
and found almost nothing — the state `FindingRecord` exists to tell apart from
a scan that never ran.
